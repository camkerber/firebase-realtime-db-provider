# react-firebase-db

The current state is a very early version of this package. I don't plan on making this more than a provider with a couple simple hooks. The goal for this package is that it's an easily extendable Firebase Provider.

I'll be making more updates including: 
- readme with a guide
- simple get and post hooks
